Game-Development Infinity Runner Game development Project

About me : Hi there! I am P Pragathi , 1st year student from MEMS department. I am eagerly expecting to be a part of the GDSC through my game development. I am a starter in this field ,yet I am determined to learn a lot and experience more through this.

About the Game: -I have developed a basic Infinity Runner game which involves Infinite running path, overcoming obstacles, and increase in difficulty as the game progresses. The game revolves around getting the highest score possible with the knowledge of your previous scores.
-The part of crossing the obstacles poses a challenge for players and as well as increases the skill for the players to analyse the strategy to cross the obstacles as the game progresses.
-There exist different types of obstacles that the player encounters and each of the obstacle is to be crossed differntly. Example,by sliding, jumping or changing the lanes. -As the game progresses, players will experience an increase in the speed of the runner which makes it a good challenge combined with the goal of also passing the obstacles without hitting on it.
-Once the player hits an obstacle , the game is over and player can either choose to play again or to exit.
-The key 'W' is to make the runner move forward, 'A' and 'D' is to make the runner move to the left and right respectively and 'S' or 'space bar' to slide . 
-These are the Basic information for how to play the game.

Speciality about the game: -The game is a simple model of any typical infinity runner game, yet it is centered around the way the player is expected to cross the obstacles without getting hit as the speed of the runner increases. -Each obstacle has a certain way to be crossed. This is yet another challenging part the player has to encounter.

Overall , the game is thrill inducing as well as super fun and is safe to be played by any age group.
